## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURAL TRANSFORMATION

### **FROM MONOLITHIC TO MODULAR**

**BEFORE:**
```
game.js (2000+ lines)
├── Player logic mixed with rendering
├── Menu system coupled with game state
├── No separation of concerns
├── Difficult to test and extend
└── Performance issues
```

**AFTER:**
```
Modular Manager System
├── GameStateManager.js (State management)
├── EntityManager.js (Player, mobs, entities)
├── RenderManager.js (All rendering operations)
├── ScoreManager.js (Scoring & achievements)
├── SaveManager.js (Save/load system)
├── InputManager.js (Advanced input handling)
├── SoundManager.js (Audio management)
├── GameConfig.js (Centralized configuration)
